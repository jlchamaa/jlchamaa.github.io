Hello!

I'm Jean-Luc --- an excessively enthusiastic engineer, designer, and maker.  I enjoy creating novel hardware and software widgets, especially in partnership with other engineers. 

I currently work as a software engineer at Zoox, an incredible company that's working on autonomous vehicles.  Previously I worked for the US Department of Defense in the Navy's Air Weapons Division.

I have a Bachelor's from UCLA in Mechanical Engineering (with technical breadth in Computer Science), 4+ years of professional experience as a software engineer, and 8+ years of project-based hands-on experience in electrical engineering, software engineering, and web development.

I'm a diligent self-learner who takes on projects with heart, both at and outside of work.  I'm always building some passion project at home, outside of being a full-time employee or student, typically doubling down my efforts during breaks, weekends, and holidays when I have more time to devote.  [Here's a list of some of the fun projects I've worked on.](projects) .

I really have a passion for the work I do, and I thrive in workplaces where people feel likewise.  If you have a job or a project that I might be able to help you with, please do reach out via e-mail at [jlchamaa@gmail.com](mailto:jlchamaa@gmail.com).

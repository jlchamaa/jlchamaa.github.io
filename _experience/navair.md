[NAWCWD](https://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/) (*knock-w-d*) is the Navy's Air Weapons Division and was my first employer out of college.  As a mechanical engineering graduate, this organization was one of the only ones willing to give me a shot at writing code. It was a pleasure to work with such dedicated mission-driven civil servants and servicemembers and develop my skills as a software engineer and as a young professional.  That the base was incredibly beautiful was only a bonus.
